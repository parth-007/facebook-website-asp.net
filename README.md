# facebook-website-asp.net
I had created this website using ASP.NET with VB.NET as backend in my bachelors. It has many features of it's own and also some of its own features. Do check it out.

I developed this in Jan, 2017 at my bachelors. It was part of my subject evaluation that we needed to create a website using ASP.NET.
I chose facebook because I always liked this.
